### Bug Fixes

* accept http client instance ([#39](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/issues/39)) ([bd9ecc3](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/commit/bd9ecc3))

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1) (2020-08-14)


### Features

* add support for api dht/query endpoint ([#37](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/issues/37)) ([6fa569c](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/commit/6fa569c))

### Chores

* make ipfs-http-client a peer dependency ([#32](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/issues/32)) ([a1b1b5e](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/commit/a1b1b5e))
* remove-peer-info-from-api ([#25](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/issues/25)) ([f49ddc0](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/commit/f49ddc0))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The ipfs-http-client must now be installed
as a peer dependency. It is no longer included as a dependency
of this module.

The reason the http-client should be a peerDependency and
not a dependency is that its API requires knowledge of the
http-client (we pass in the api endpoint details).
* findPeer returns id and addrs properties instead of peer-info instance

* chore: address review

### BREAKING CHANGES

* API refactored to use async/await

Also upgrades all the deps, moves from `ipfs-api` to `ipfs-http-client`
and removes a lot of results massaging that is now done in the
http client.
